# Contribute at Lorean!

We would love to see anyone who likes to improve Lorean participate in its development!
Please follow these easy guidelines to get started - can't wait to see what you build.

1. Test your changes or added features to the maximum as Lorean is a backup management software that aims to be as reliable as possible.
2. Follow the code formatting guidelines below to keep the code as clean as possible and readable.
3. Create good and detailed descriptions for any commits/pull requests as this greatly improves collaboration.
4. Help others review their pull requests as well - this speeds up the development significantly.

## Code formatting guidelines

1. Please format any code using **4 spaces**. Usage of alternating spaces/tabs will make the Python parser error out.
2. Use descriptive variable names and try to document rather hard-to-understand code passages using comments.
3. In this codebase, there is a rather dogmatic use of spacing required in python code to keep it as readable as possible.

**Rather write**:
```
function(
    argument = "value",
    argument2 = 42
)
```

**Than**:
```
function(argument="value", argument2=42)
```
